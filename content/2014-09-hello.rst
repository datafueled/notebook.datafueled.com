Hello!

This is going to be my notebook for writing out thoughts, opinions, and so
on while I investigate a variety of technologies and start to do things with
them.

At the start, these technologies will include a lot of stuff related to
linked data, the semantic web, ontologies and similar things. I will also be
looking at how those technologies are used by news organizations (such as the
BBC, the New York Times and Thompson Reuters).
